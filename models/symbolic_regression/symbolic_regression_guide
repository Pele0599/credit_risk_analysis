for a symbolic regressor, these are some of the parameters which are important
to remember, and also their significance:

- population_size = number of initial trees, which can be used for mutation and crossover
- generations = number of generations we run the program for 
- p_crossover = probability that two trees form together, and create a new offspring 
- p_mutation = probability of mutating a node inside a tree
- function_set = different functions we can use in symbolic regression, for example
sqrt, exp, tanh, sin, cos, add, sub, div, mult,
- parsimony_coefficient = increases the loss, by penalizing longer terms in the final output
